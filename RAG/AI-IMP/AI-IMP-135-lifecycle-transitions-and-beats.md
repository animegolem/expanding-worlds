# AI-IMP-135-lifecycle-transitions-and-beats

## Summary of Issue #1

> SCOPE ADDITION (2026-07-07, PR #14 review P3, via AI-IMP-160): the
> open book binds to a rotated image's AABB, not its rendered edge —
> rings float beside rotated art. In this ticket, gate the `bound`
> presentation on rotation === 0: rotated image anchors keep the
> tethered card until a rotated-book design exists (flag the gap in
> HUMAN-TESTING at merge). NotePanel.svelte:646/708 are the sites.

EPIC-023 FR-2. Rev 0.55 §8.5: the lifecycle is freely reversible
with one undoable command per transition, and the hardware +
shadow tell the state. Done means: book —tear→ sticky (tape +
torn edge, viewport-fixed, shadow, ~300ms one-shot beat); sticky
—untape→ book (tear reversed, ~200ms); sticky —place→ landmark
(existing place-on-board, now KEEPING the torn edge and wearing
the push pin, flat); landmark —pull pin→ sticky; landmark
—dismiss→ page returns to its book. Double-click on the bound
page tears it to a CENTERED editor over the dimmed board (the
big-editor moment reskinned as the torn-out page at modal rung,
scroll inside the page, esc/click-off tucks it home). Each
transition is one undo entry; mid-flight anything wears
`--ew-drag-shadow`.

### Out of Scope

- New persistence: sticky/pinned state stays presentation state as
  today; the landmark stays the card-appearance placement (§4.6).
  The torn-edge fact rides note presentation state (settings-table
  pattern), NO migration.
- Fancy paper physics; beats are the ratified one-shots only.
- The book-cover-open beat (musing, queued).

### Design/Approach

Transitions map onto the EXISTING command/presentation seams:
tear = pin (presentation flip + beat), untape = unpin,
place = place-on-board (compound: placement + torn-edge
presentation fact, one undo group via `runAsUndoGroup`),
pull-pin = the rev 0.55 REVERSAL — a compound that removes the
placement and restores the sticky (placement delete + presentation
flip, one group; §9 impact rules apply if the placement is the
node's last — surface the standard confirm). Landmark rendering:
the card body gains the torn-edge + push-pin chrome variant
(canvas-engine card renderer consumes 130's tokens + a PushPin
bake or vector draw). Beats: EW_BEAT_TEAR_MS/etc. from 130,
one-shot CSS animation on the DOM panel (world beat budget);
NEVER looping; reduced-motion respected if the app has a
convention (check; else note). The centered tear reuses the big
editor's overlay slot with the paper chrome; scroll containment
verified. §8.5 indicator table consistency: the bound page's
on-screen row ("the tail is the attribution") updates to "the
binding is the attribution" — RFC touch-up rides this ticket's
close, flagged for the lead.

### Files to Touch

`apps/desktop/src/renderer/note/NotePanel.svelte`, `panels.ts`,
`note/paper/*`: sticky + landmark variants, transitions, beats.
`apps/desktop/src/renderer/note/open-note.ts` (fly/home chip
seams as needed).
`packages/canvas-engine/src/renderers/placement.ts` (+ test):
card body torn-edge/pin variant behind a presentation flag.
`apps/desktop/e2e/note-lifecycle.spec.ts`: extend — full cycle
book→sticky→landmark→sticky→book with one undo per step walking
back; centered tear + esc tuck.

### Implementation Checklist

<CRITICAL_RULE>
Before marking an item complete on the checklist MUST **stop** and **think**. Have you validated all aspects are **implemented** and **tested**?
</CRITICAL_RULE>

- [ ] Tear/untape: presentation flips with beats, tape + torn
      edge persist on the sticky, shadow only while
      floating/viewport-fixed.
- [ ] Place → landmark: torn edge + push pin on the card, flat,
      one undo group.
- [ ] Pull pin / dismiss: reversal compounds, §9 confirm when
      applicable, one undo each; e2e walks the full cycle.
- [ ] Centered tear: modal-rung page over dimmed board, scroll
      inside, esc/click-off tucks home (~200ms reverse beat).
- [ ] Beats one-shot (no loops — guard or review), constants from
      130.
- [ ] Gates: `pnpm -r build`, `pnpm -r test`, `pnpm lint`, desktop
      e2e hidden.
- [ ] HUMAN-TESTING entry appended at merge by the lead (playful
      vs twee; tear timing; pull-pin discoverability).

### Acceptance Criteria

**GIVEN** a bound page
**WHEN** pinned, placed, pin-pulled, and untaped in sequence
**THEN** each state wears its hardware (rings/tape/pin), each
transition is one Mod+Z step, and the full walk returns to the
original bound page.
**GIVEN** a double-click on the page
**THEN** it tears to center over the dimmed board, scrolls
internally, and esc tucks it back.
